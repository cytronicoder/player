This is a minimal Electron + React music player for local playback. It supports basic playback controls and a simple UI.

I built this because my Spotify subscription expired and I was boarding a flight to Shenzhen — I wanted something lightweight so I can jam to my local music files without internet access.

Prerequisites: Node 18+ and pnpm

Layout:
src/main — Electron main process
src/renderer — React renderer and UI
music/ — local music files

Notes
See `package.json` for available scripts and license information.
